            <h3>A good father</h3>
            <p>
                We were young when we had her. I was twenty-three, the mother was twenty; we weren't planning to
                have
                kids yet. I don't want to say the relationship fell apart because of our daughter. It was mostly
                us.
                We
                were going through a stressful time: I'd just lost my mother, she'd just lost her grandmother.
                We
                were
                going through an eviction and had to move into a shelter. We just handled our stress in
                different
                ways.
                She dealt with it by wanting to be young and dumb and free. We were arguing about everything,
                and
                I'm
                not good at arguing. I don't like confrontation. I get agitated, antsy. Every time there was an
                argument, I'd get so angry that I'd have to leave the facility to get some air. I've been that
                way
                since
                childhood. My mom and my dad were heavy addicts; they lost custody of me when I was four. I grew
                up
                in
                programs. I didn't have nobody to show me affection. And it made me angry, I was an angry kid. I
                saw
                that other people had love, and understood it, and to be honest, I wasn't okay with it. There
                are
                times
                where I still feel like that, sometimes even now as a father. But every time I look at her it
                goes
                away.
                It went away the moment she was born. When you held your first kid, did you see a glow around
                them?
                Did
                you ever see a glow? Because I saw a glow. And I felt it. It was like, holy shit. I wanted to
                cry
                the
                first time I felt it, because I wasn't sure what it was. I was confused. But as it gradually
                grew on
                me,
                I was like: OK, so this is what love is. And it felt beautiful. It made me want to be better. I
                don't
                want my daughter seeing the side of me from when I was young and didn't know how to cope with my
                anger.
                Right now I have her every day after school. There's a counselor at her school: Mr. Gonzalez. I
                go
                to
                see him once, sometimes twice a week. He's been very helpful. He's teaching me how to cope with
                life,
                how to handle arguments with my baby's mother. Now if she texts me twenty paragraphs about
                things
                that
                happened six years ago, I don't fight back. I just don't respond, until it's time to get the
                baby
